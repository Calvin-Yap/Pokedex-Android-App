# Pokedex-Android-App
Part of the MLH tutorial on how to create a fully functioning pokedex using Algolia and Android Studios.

This was my first time diving into the world of mobile app development, and what better way to do so with creating a pokedex.

Using android studio's I was able to create a simple pokedex app in which users are able to search up pokemon of their choice.

I was planning to further the development of this project to make it work alongside the popular mobile game pokemon GO as it would allow players to serach up the pokemon that they have recently caught to learn more on the go.
